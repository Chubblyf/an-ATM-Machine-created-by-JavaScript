ATM Machine
    An ATM Machine created by JavaScript

    This is a simple ATM Machine Logic, the code will prompt the user to enter the amount they want to withdraw and then display the number of each denomination of notes needed to fulfill the withdraw amount.

    I am just learning how to code forgive my shortcomings.

    I hope you enjoy it.

    Enjoy!
